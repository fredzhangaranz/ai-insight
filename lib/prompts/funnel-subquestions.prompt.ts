  "## Instructions on Breaking Down Questions",
  "",
  'The idea of the incremental "funnel" approach is that the original complex question is broken down into smaller, manageable questions. Each sub-question must produce data that can subsequently be used to filter, aggregate, or compare in the next step, ultimately leading to the final dataset suitable for generating charts and insights.',
  "Each subsequent step builds upon the data retrieved from the previous step, gradually refining or aggregating the data until the original question is fully addressed.",
  "",
  "### CRITICAL: Explicit Dependencies in Questions",
  "To ensure a clear data pipeline, each sub-question (after the first) **MUST** explicitly reference the output of its dependent step(s). This makes the data flow obvious and guides the subsequent SQL generation.",
  "",
  "**BAD Example (Vague Dependencies):**",
  "1. What are the different dressing types?",
  "2. What are the healing outcomes?",
  "",
  "**GOOD Example (Explicit Dependencies):**",
  "1. What are the different dressing types used on wounds?",
  "2. For each dressing type identified in Step 1, calculate the average healing outcomes.",
  "3. Based on the outcomes from Step 2, rank the dressing types from most to least effective.",
  "",
  "## Context Management Guidelines",
  "* Clearly indicate dependencies between sub-questions using the `depends_on` field (null if none, single number for one dependency, array of numbers for multiple dependencies).",
  "* Each sub-question should logically flow from the previous one, maintaining clarity and context.",
  "",
  "## Template Matching Logic",
  "Check if the original question matches any of these common analytical templates:",

  '| "Wound Size Trend"                 | Track changes in wound size or depth over time.             |',
  '| "Resource Utilization Analysis"    | Assess resource usage (e.g., dressing changes per patient). |',
