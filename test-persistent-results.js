console.log("\n‚úÖ Implementation Details:");
console.log(
  "- Added subQuestionResults state to FunnelContainer to store results per sub-question ID"
);
console.log(
  "- Added handleQueryResult function to store results when queries execute"
);
console.log("- Added initialResults and onQueryResult props to FunnelPanel");
console.log(
  "- Fixed bug: Reset queryResult state when navigating between sub-questions"
);
console.log(
  "- Updated Results section to show appropriate messages based on SQL existence"
);
console.log(
  "- Results persist within the same funnel session until user leaves"
);

console.log("\nüéØ Expected Behavior:");
console.log(
  "- Results are cleared when navigating to different sub-questions (bug fix)"
);
console.log("- Results persist when navigating back to the same sub-question");
console.log("- Each sub-question maintains its own independent results");
console.log(
  "- Results are cleared when SQL changes (from previous improvement)"
);
console.log("- Clear messaging guides users on what to do next");

console.log("\nüêõ Bug Fix Summary:");
console.log(
  "- Previously: Results from completed sub-question would show in pending sub-question"
);
console.log(
  "- Now: Results are properly reset when navigating between sub-questions"
);
console.log(
  "- Added useEffect to reset queryResult, executionError, and resultViewMode on subQuestion.id change"
);
