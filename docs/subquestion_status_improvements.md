# Sub-Question Status Workflow Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the sub-question status workflow in the AI-powered query generation system, along with additional proposed enhancements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Status Updates on Query Execution

**File Modified:** `app/api/ai/execute-query/route.ts`

**Changes:**

- Added optional `subQuestionId` parameter to the execute-query API
- When a query executes successfully and returns at least one result, the sub-question status is automatically updated to "completed"
- Added error handling to prevent status update failures from breaking the query execution

**API Request Format:**

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM table",
  "subQuestionId": "123"
}
```

### 2. Manual "Mark as Complete" Buttons

**File Modified:** `components/funnel/FunnelPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `onMarkComplete` prop to the FunnelPanel interface
- Added `handleMarkComplete` function that updates the sub-question status via API call
- Added "Mark as Complete" button in two locations:
  1. **Header Section:** Next to the status badge (small green button with âœ“ icon)
  2. **Results Section:** Below the results display (full-width green button)

**Button Behavior:**

- Only visible when `onMarkComplete` prop is provided and status is not "completed"
- Updates status to "completed" via API call to `/api/ai/funnel/subquestions/[id]/status`
- Calls parent callback to update local state

### 3. Updated Component Hierarchy

**Files Modified:**

- `components/funnel/FunnelContainer.tsx`
- `app/funnel-test/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `onMarkComplete` prop to FunnelContainer interface
- Implemented `handleMarkComplete` function in FunnelContainer
- Updated FunnelPanel rendering to pass the `onMarkComplete` callback
- Added handler in funnel-test page for testing

### 4. Enhanced Query Execution

**File Modified:** `components/funnel/FunnelPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Updated `handleExecuteSql` function to pass `subQuestionId` to the execute-query API
- This enables automatic status updates when queries execute successfully

### 5. Clear Results on SQL Change âœ… **COMPLETED**

**File Modified:** `components/funnel/FunnelPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added result clearing to `handleGenerateSql` function when SQL is regenerated
- Added result clearing to `handleSqlSave` function when SQL is manually edited and saved
- Added `resultsCleared` state to track when results are cleared
- Added helpful message in Results section: "Results cleared due to SQL changes. Click Execute to run the updated query."
- Added `useEffect` to reset cleared flag when navigating to different sub-questions
- Reset cleared flag when executing new queries

**Benefits:**

- Prevents confusion from stale results when SQL changes
- Provides clear visual feedback to users
- Ensures users only see fresh results after SQL modifications
- Maintains good UX by guiding users to re-execute queries

## Proposed Additional Workflow Improvements

### 6. Persistent Results Across Navigation âœ… **COMPLETED**

**File Modified:** `components/funnel/FunnelContainer.tsx` and `components/funnel/FunnelPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `subQuestionResults` state to `FunnelContainer` to store results per sub-question ID
- Added `handleQueryResult` function to store results when queries execute successfully
- Added `initialResults` and `onQueryResult` props to `FunnelPanel` interface
- Fixed bug: Reset `queryResult`, `executionError`, and `resultViewMode` when navigating between sub-questions
- Updated Results section to show appropriate messages based on SQL existence
- Results persist within the same funnel session until user leaves

**Bug Fix:**

- **Problem:** Results from completed sub-questions were showing in pending sub-questions
- **Solution:** Added `useEffect` to reset result states when `subQuestion.id` changes
- **Result:** Clean navigation between sub-questions with proper state management

**Benefits:**

- Results persist when navigating back to the same sub-question
- Each sub-question maintains its own independent results
- No more confusion from results appearing in wrong sub-questions
- Better user experience with persistent data within the session

### 7. Mark Complete Validation âœ… **COMPLETED**

**File Modified:** `components/funnel/FunnelPanel.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added validation check in `handleMarkComplete` function to warn users when no SQL query exists
- Updated button styling: green for sub-questions with SQL, yellow for those without SQL
- Updated button text: "Mark Sub-Question Complete" vs "Mark Complete (No SQL)"
- Updated tooltips to provide context about SQL status
- Applied changes to both header and bottom "Mark as Complete" buttons

**Validation Logic:**

- Checks if `subQuestion.sqlQuery` exists and is not empty
- Shows confirmation dialog with helpful message when no SQL exists
- Allows users to proceed or cancel based on their choice
- Prevents accidental completion without proper analysis

**Benefits:**

- Prevents users from accidentally marking incomplete sub-questions as complete
- Clear visual indicators show which sub-questions are ready for completion
- Users are guided to generate SQL queries before marking complete
- Maintains flexibility while encouraging best practices

### 8. Visual Status Indicators ðŸ“Š **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Users can't quickly see which sub-questions have results vs. which are empty.

**Proposed Solution:**

- Add visual indicators in step navigation
- Show icons: ðŸ“Š for results, âšª for empty, âœ… for completed
- Help users quickly identify progress and available data

**Implementation:**

- Modify step indicators in `FunnelContainer.tsx`
- Add result status to sub-question data structure

### 9. Smart Navigation Logic ðŸ§  **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Navigation doesn't guide users through the workflow naturally.

**Proposed Solution:**

- Show prominent action buttons based on current state:
  - "Generate SQL" when SQL is empty
  - "Execute Query" when SQL exists but no results
  - "View Results" when results are available

**Implementation:**

- Add conditional action buttons in `FunnelPanel.tsx`
- Update navigation logic in `FunnelContainer.tsx`

### 10. Query Execution History ðŸ“… **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Users don't know when results were last generated.

**Proposed Solution:**

- Show timestamp of last execution for each sub-question
- Add "Last executed: 2 minutes ago" indicators
- Help users understand data freshness

**Implementation:**

- Store execution timestamps in sub-question data
- Display in UI with relative time formatting

### 11. Query Validation âœ… **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Users may execute problematic queries without warnings.

**Proposed Solution:**

- Show warnings for potential SQL issues
- Highlight missing WHERE clauses, large result sets, etc.
- Prevent wasted execution attempts

**Implementation:**

- Add SQL validation logic in `FunnelPanel.tsx`
- Show warning badges before execution

### 12. Bulk Operations âš¡ **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem:** No efficient way to handle multiple sub-questions at once.

**Proposed Solution:**

- Add "Execute All" button to run all pending queries
- Add "Mark All Complete" for quick completion
- Useful for power users and batch processing

### 13. Results Export ðŸ“¤ **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem:** Users can't easily export results for external analysis.

**Proposed Solution:**

- Add CSV/JSON export functionality
- Include export buttons in results section
- Support for further analysis outside the tool

## Workflow Summary

### Automatic Completion (Option A)

1. User clicks "Execute" button for a SQL query
2. Query executes via `/api/ai/execute-query` with `subQuestionId`
3. If query returns at least one result, status automatically updates to "completed"
4. UI reflects the status change immediately

### Manual Completion (Option B)

1. User clicks "Mark as Complete" button (either in header or below results)
2. Status updates to "completed" via API call
3. UI reflects the status change immediately

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility:** Users can complete sub-questions even without executing queries
2. **Automation:** Successful query execution automatically marks questions as complete
3. **Clear UI:** Multiple button locations make it easy to mark questions complete
4. **Consistency:** Status updates are handled through the same API endpoint
5. **Error Handling:** Status update failures don't break query execution
