2. **QR Code Placement**: Bottom right, large (10cm × 10cm minimum), high contrast background
3. **Color Proofing**: Request a color proof from printer before final run—colors look different in print vs. screen
4. **Backup Plan**: Have digital version on tablet in case of poster damage during travel
5. **Photo Opportunity**: Design includes space for CEO to stand beside without blocking content
6. **Lighting**: Bring portable LED light if booth lighting is poor
