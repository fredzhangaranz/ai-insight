Project Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Analytics POC

Project Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Analytics POC

- Project Name: InsightGen (Proof-of-Concept)
- Status: Inception / Draft
- Date: June 18, 2025

1. App Overview
   Background & Problem
   Silhouette Central holds a wealth of valuable clinical data, including highly configurable assessment forms and quantitative wound measurements. Currently, deriving meaningful insights from this data is a lengthy, manual, and costly process. It relies on a slow, reactive support-to-development pipeline to build custom dashboards. Furthermore, customers often don't know what analytical questions to ask, making it difficult to provide proactive, valuable reporting.
   Vision & Solution
   This document outlines a proof-of-concept (POC) application, InsightGen, designed to demonstrate a new paradigm for data analytics. InsightGen will leverage a Large Language Model (AI) to dynamically analyze the structure of any configured form, suggest relevant clinical and operational questions, and instantly generate the corresponding data visualizations.
   The goal of this POC is to showcase the feasibility and business value of AI-driven analytics, with the ultimate aim of embedding this capability into Silhouette Central to empower users with self-serve, on-demand insights.
2. User Flows
   The application will support two primary user journeys for a single, selected form.
   Flow 1: All-Patient Aggregate Analysis
3. Launch: The user opens the InsightGen application.
4. Form Discovery: The user is presented with a list of available forms from the database (e.g., "Wound Assessment", "Patient Intake").
5. Form Selection: The user selects a form, for example, "Wound Assessment".
6. Schema Visualization: The application displays the fields configured for the "Wound Assessment" form as a visual reference.
7. AI Analysis: The user clicks an "Analyze with AI" button.
8. Insight Suggestion: The application displays a categorized list of potential questions (insights) generated by the AI based on the form's structure.
9. Question Selection: The user selects a question relevant to the entire patient population, such as "What are the 5 most common wound etiologies?"
10. Insight Delivery: The application displays a single view containing:
    _ A dynamically generated chart (e.g., a bar chart) visualizing the answer.
    _ The raw SQL query generated by the AI to produce this data. \* A simple table view of the data returned by the query.
    Flow 2: Single-Patient Trend Analysis
11. Initial steps (1-6) are identical to Flow 1.
12. Question Selection: The user selects a question relevant to a single patient's journey, such as "Show the wound healing trend over time."
13. Patient Context: The application prompts the user with a dropdown or list of patients who have data for the selected form.
14. Patient Selection: The user chooses a specific patient.
15. Insight Delivery: The application displays the same three-part view (chart, SQL, table), but now showing the time-series data for the selected patient (e.g., a line chart of wound area vs. date).
16. Tech Stack & APIs

- Framework: Next.js (using TypeScript)
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend & API Layer: Next.js API Routes
- Data Visualization: A JavaScript charting library like Recharts or Chart.js (via react-chartjs-2).
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server (the existing Silhouette Central demo database).
- Database Connector: The mssql Node.js library.
- AI Engine API: Anthropic Claude API.

4. Core Features

- F1: Form Discovery: An API endpoint and UI component to list all available forms from the database.
- F2: Dynamic Form Renderer: A UI component that takes a form's JSON schema and visually displays its fields (e.g., text inputs, dropdowns) as a non-interactive reference.
- F3: AI-Powered Insight Suggestion: A backend service that sends a form's JSON schema to the Claude API and receives a categorized list of relevant analytical questions.
- F4: AI-Powered SQL Generation: A backend service that takes a user-selected question and the form schema, prompts the Claude API to generate a SQL query, and suggests an appropriate chart type (e.g., bar, line, pie).
- F5: Dynamic Data Visualization: A frontend component that accepts a dataset and a chart type, rendering a responsive chart.
- F6: Patient Selection Module: A UI dropdown or modal that is populated with relevant patients when a single-patient insight is requested.
- F7: Transparency View: UI components dedicated to clearly displaying the generated SQL query (with syntax highlighting) and the raw data in a simple table format.

5. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope
   Defining clear boundaries is critical for ensuring the POC can be delivered quickly and effectively.
   ✅ In-Scope for this POC

- Connecting to a single, predefined demo MS SQL database with known credentials.
- Supporting 1-2 specific forms (e.g., the "WoundAssessment" form) for demonstration.
- Full implementation of the two user flows described above.
- The AI prompt will be "primed" with a developer-provided, hardcoded description of the relevant database table schema.
- Basic UI/UX with a clean layout suitable for a stakeholder demo.
- Basic loading states and error handling (e.g., "AI query failed, please try again").
  ❌ Out-of-Scope for this POC
- User Authentication/Authorization: The application will be open and public for the demo.
- Training a Custom AI Model: We will exclusively use the existing Claude API.
- HIPAA-Compliant Deployment: The POC will run locally or on a simple hosting service (like Vercel); it is not intended for use with real PHI.
- Saving or Exporting Reports: The generated insights are ephemeral and for demonstration only.
- User-Defined Natural Language Input: The user will select from AI-suggested questions, not type their own arbitrary questions. This controls the complexity of the AI task.
- Connecting to multiple or unknown database schemas.
- Production-grade security, scalability, or performance optimization.
